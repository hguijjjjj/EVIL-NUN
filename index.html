            <h5>Sister Madeline was not always a nun, she was actually a very smart scientist who had a daughter named Elisa. They were probably a happy family, judging by the photos in Evil Nun 2. But when a war broke out in her country, Elisa died due to a bombing, Sister Madeline somehow escaped and fled to The United States and there, she became a nun who was trying to forget all the things that had happened. But, Sister Madeline missed her daughter so much that she started conducting crazy experiments, so that she can find a way to resurrect Elisa back to life... by trying to use the bodies of other children of Elisa's age so that she can bring the soul of Elisa into the bodies of the other kids, but if they didn't become a match. She will kill them.Sister Madeline sends a letter to the victim's parents saying that their child has been punished, but instead, she kidnapped children in hopes that once the ritual is complete, it will restore her dead daughter Elisa. She adopted three chickens, Gummy, Roostel, and Mr. C, to help capture the children and make their chances of escaping slimmer, however the chickens becomes completely harmless if you turn them normal by making a recipe, when you get the true ending, she becomes pregnant from Nàzrat's magic after she is done talking to him. If you have played Ice Scream 5, there in the memories, you can see a girl sitting which was Elisa, her late daughter, which later her soul became a part of Rod, her son which Nàzrat gave her.Due to failing to obey two out of three rules from Nazrat, she became much more insane and her physical appearance was changed, she does not behave the same way she used to be, In this game she's silent, holding sadistic smile while her eyes are turned red, she also uses children for laundry and forces them to wear masks, enforcing them to write on board of being a good student, if they misbehave, she will punish them by hitting them with hammer, she will not hesitate to do it even if they just leave their room and nothing else (which is the reason she chases after player) in all possible endings of player's escape the Nun is seen watching him leaving with no attempts to chase after child, or simply isn't aware of his escape.
The true ending shows the player, Crafter Boy, lost children, and the mysterious man (known as William Bismarch) successfully escape from the school, the nun then goes into the pink room carrying the hammer as it was her baby (since she still missed her son and daughter), then the player's name disappears from the pink room and the starting room, then the credits play as the balloon goes by.Evil Nun Rush tells the story and mysteries of Evil Nun with countless floors and infinity. How Sister Madeline turned into a nasty creature and her bond with William Bismarch and Nazrat and the chalice as William lurks in the labyrinthine hallways of Eagle Junior High School.Sister Madeline appears in Horror Brawl as a horror that can transform the player from 4 gems and with unique abilities.
